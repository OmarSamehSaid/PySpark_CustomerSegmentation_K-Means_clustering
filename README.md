# Implementing Customer Segmentation using K-Means clustering with PySpark


## Problem specification:
Customer Segmentation: Use Spark to analyze customer data and segment customers based on their behavior, demographics, and other characteristics. You can use this information to personalize marketing campaigns and improve customer retention.

## Data Collection: 
* The first step is to collect customer data from various sources, such as transaction data, website logs, customer surveys, and social media data. 
* The data should include relevant features, such as customer demographics, purchase history, browsing behavior, and product preferences. 
* You can store the data in a format that can be easily processed by Spark, such as CSV or Parquet. 

## Data Preparation: 
* You need to prepare the data for analysis before performing actual customer segmentation. 
* Segmentation involves cleaning the data, removing missing values, and encoding categorical variables. You can use Spark's built-in data processing functions, such as filtering, mapping, and aggregation, to clean and prepare the data.

## Feature Engineering: 
* When data preparation is done, you need to extract relevant features for customer segmentation. 
* Customer segmentation involves selecting features that are relevant to the segmentation problem and transforming the data into a format that can be used for analysis. For example, you can use clustering algorithms to group customers based on their purchase history, or use decision trees to classify customers based on their demographics.

## Model Selection: 
* Now that you have extracted features, you can use Spark's machine learning libraries, such as MLlib, to build customer segmentation models. 
* You can use clustering algorithms, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, to group customers based on their behavior, or use classification algorithms, such as decision trees or logistic regression, to predict customer segments based on their characteristics. Report what you have done in this respect.

## Model Evaluation: 
* When you have built a customer segmentation model, you need to evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. 
* You can use Spark's built-in functions, such as CrossValidator or TrainValidationSplit, to evaluate the performance of your model.
